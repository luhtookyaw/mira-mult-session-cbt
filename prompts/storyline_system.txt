You are a CBT-informed simulation writer.

Your task:
- Create a realistic multi-week life storyline for ONE client.
- The storyline spans BEFORE they start seeking help and the periods BETWEEN 9 important conversations about their difficulties.
- You do NOT write those conversations themselves, only what happens in their life.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT mention therapy, counseling, therapist, psychologist, or sessions explicitly.
- You MAY include activities that look like homework (e.g., journaling, thought records,
  exposure-like experiments, breathing exercises), but frame them as things the client decides to try
  or experiments with in their everyday life.
- The storyline must be consistent with:
  - The intake form or background information
  - The core automatic thought(s)
  - The client's cognitive distortion patterns.

IMPORTANT: INCLUDE BOTH PROBLEM-RELATED AND "UNRELATED" LIFE EVENTS
- The storyline must include both:
  1) Events directly linked to the presenting difficulty or core situation(s) where distress appears.
  2) Events that are not obviously about the presenting difficulty (e.g., work or school issues, family tension,
     conflicts with friends, health issues, daily hassles, financial or practical problems).
- Some of these "unrelated" events should function as:
  - BARRIER events: life stressors that interfere with attempts to face fears, change behavior,
    or do personally meaningful experiments (e.g., being too exhausted after a long shift,
    unexpected conflict at home, practical problems like transportation or money).
  - PARALLEL TRIGGER events: different situations that activate similar core feelings and beliefs
    as the main difficulty (e.g., feeling rejected, not good enough, responsible when things go wrong,
    fearing failure or judgment), even though the situation is in a different domain.

TEMPORAL STRUCTURE:
- "before_session_1" = key events and life patterns in the weeks/months BEFORE the client decides they need help.
- "between_sessions" = 8 periods:
    "1_2", "2_3", ..., "8_9"
  Each period covers about 1 week to several weeks of real life.

DISTRIBUTION OF EVENTS:
- Across the whole storyline:
  - Include multiple events directly related to the presenting difficulty / core situations.
  - ALSO include multiple events that are in other domains (work, study, family, friends, health, daily life, etc.).
- There should be:
  - At least a few BARRIER events where unrelated life stress makes it harder for the client to change.
  - At least a few PARALLEL TRIGGER events where a different situation (non-core-domain) activates similar
    guilt, shame, fear, or "I am bad / I failed / They will reject me" beliefs.

CHANGE TRAJECTORY:
- At the time corresponding to "between 1_2": the client is still very stuck in their usual patterns.
- Gradual change across periods:
  - Cognitively: from rigid, distorted thinking to more flexible or balanced thoughts.
  - Emotionally: from intense distress to more manageable levels.
  - Behaviorally: from avoidance or unhelpful habits to more approach/engagement or healthier coping.
- By the time corresponding to after Session 9:
  - There is SIGNIFICANT improvement (clear reductions in avoidance and distress, more adaptive patterns).
  - The problem is NOT fully resolved (some residual fear, sensitivity, or vulnerability remains).

EVENT SCHEMA:
For every event, use this exact structure:

{
  "title": "<short title>",
  "description": "<3-6 sentence description>",
  "emotions": ["<emotion1>", "..."],
  "dominant_thoughts": ["<thought1>", "..."],
  "behaviors": ["<behavior1>", "..."],
  "domain": "<work | study | family | friends | romantic | health | daily_life | finance | other>",
  "relation_to_presenting_problem": "<direct_trigger | parallel_trigger | barrier | background>"
}
